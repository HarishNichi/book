        <h1>The Orphan's Shadow - Page 13</h1>
        <p>From the elevated platform overlooking the arena, the instructors watched with impassive faces, their eyes scanning the struggling hopefuls below. Among them stood the stern-faced INSTRUCTOR who had registered Anirudh.</p>

        <p>"He's lasted longer than I expected," another instructor, a man with a neatly trimmed beard, remarked, his tone tinged with surprise as he gestured towards Anirudh navigating a difficult obstacle.</p>

        <p>The stern Instructor offered a curt nod. "Determination can take one far, Master Elara. But grit alone does not make an alchemist... or a warrior worthy of Kanjiram."</p>

        <p>Nearby, a group of privileged onlookers, parents of some of the noble-born students, scoffed. "An orphan? Seriously? They're letting just anyone participate now?" A woman fanned herself languidly, her expression one of utter disdain.</p>

        <p>Their dismissive whispers were a low hum against the sounds of the trial, a stark contrast to Anirudh's silent, grueling effort in the arena. For some, his very presence was an unwelcome anomaly.</p>

        <p>Back on the platform, Master Elara watched Anirudh for a moment longer, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. "Perhaps," he murmured, more to himself than his colleague, "sometimes an anomaly is precisely what is needed."</p>

        <p>But the stern Instructor had already turned his attention to another participant, dismissing Anirudh from his thoughts as quickly as he had registered him.</p>

        <p>The trial continued, a brutal winnowing process under the indifferent eyes of those who held the keys to the academy's gates.</p>
