                <p>Anirudh focused inward, drawing upon the silence meditation Arjun had taught him. The cacophony of sound around him began to fade, replaced by a deep, internal calm. Vana's sonic attacks still vibrated through the air, but their ability to distort his senses was greatly diminished. He could now perceive the subtle shifts in energy that preceded her sonic blasts.</p>
                <p>With his mind clear, Anirudh moved with renewed precision. He no longer reacted wildly to the disorienting sounds but anticipated Vana's attacks, using minimal movements to evade the most potent waves. He could feel the strain on Vana as he neutralized her primary weapon. She was forced to resort to more conventional close-quarters combat, where Anirudh, grounded by his controlled energy, held the advantage.</p>
