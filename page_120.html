            <h2>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h2>
            <h3>Scene 7: Rebirth of Will</h3>
            
            <p>...Anirudh went back to the mountain cave. The incomplete scroll, titled “To Rise, First Die,” now made a strange kind of sense after facing true peril. It wasn’t about a physical resurrection, but a death of his old self, the one clinging to his father’s legacy and Arjun’s teachings.</p>

            <p>He sat in silent meditation, not to control his energy as Vana had forced him to learn, but to listen. To the wind that had guided him against the Flame Serpent. To the stillness of mind he’d found against the Ice Tiger. To the foresight granted by the Phantom Crow's spiritual sight.</p>
            
            <p>Slowly, painstakingly, he began to weave these disparate threads together. Not his father's brutal, earth-shattering blows. Not Arjun's fluid, evasive style. Something new. Something that felt like his own.</p>
            
            <p>Vayu Vajra. The Wind Thunder Form.</p>
            
            <p>A style born of necessity and self-discovery. It combined the fluid evasion of wind, the sharp precision of lightning strikes, and the explosive power of thunder.</p>
