            <h2>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h2>
            <h3>Scene: Rebirth of Will</h3>
            <p>Anirudh, back in the quiet of the mountain cave, finally felt a shift within. The words of the incomplete scroll, "To Rise, First Die," resonated differently now. He understood that "die" didn't mean a literal end, but the shedding of old ways, of expectations and limitations.</p>
            <p>He closed his eyes, focusing on the essence of the Flame Serpent's adaptability, the Ice Tiger's focused power, and the Phantom Crow's elusive grace. These weren't just techniques; they were philosophies of movement and energy flow.</p>
