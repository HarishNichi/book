            <h3>Scene 8: The Master's Acknowledgment (Continued)</h3>
            <p>Arjun stepped back, a rare smile gracing his lips. "Not surpassed," he repeated, his voice soft but resonant. "Only accepted who you are."</p>
            <p>Anirudh felt a profound shift within him. He wasn't a copy, a successor defined by another's legacy. He was Anirudh, forged in his own trials, his own discoveries.</p>
            <p>In a gesture that spoke volumes, Arjun bowed. It was not the bow of a master to a student, but the acknowledgment of an equal. The years of rigorous training, the harsh lessons, the moments of despair â€“ they had all led to this.</p>
            <p>A sudden rustle of parchment broke the silence. A messenger bird, swift and silent, landed on the dojo's ancient windowsill, a sealed scroll tied to its leg.</p>
