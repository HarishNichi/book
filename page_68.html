            <p>The arena roared. Anirudh faced his next opponent, Vana, The Sound Bender. Vana stepped into the ring, an unnerving stillness surrounding her despite the cacophony of the crowd. She raised her hands, and the air itself seemed to hum.</p>
            <p>Anirudh felt the first wave of distorted sound. It wasn't loud, but it twisted his senses, making the solid ground seem to undulate and the distant cheers sound like whispers right beside his ear. He stumbled, momentarily disoriented.</p>
            <p>"The sound," Arjun's voice echoed in his memory, "it is a distraction. Find the stillness within."</p>
            <p>Anirudh closed his eyes, focusing inward. He remembered the silence meditation Arjun had taught him, a technique to control his own internal energy and shut out external noise.</p>
            <p>He took a deep breath, centering himself. The distorted sounds lessened, though they didn't vanish entirely. He could now perceive the true source of Vana's power â€“ subtle vibrations in the air, manipulated with practiced ease.</p>
