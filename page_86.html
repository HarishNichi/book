            <h2>Scene 7: Rebirth of Will</h2>
            <p>Anirudh stood before the ancient vault, the cool air of the cavern a stark contrast to the fiery trial he had endured. The incomplete scroll titled "To Rise, First Die" seemed to pulse with a faint, dark energy. Before, it had represented a desperate, final gamble. Now, it felt different. The chaos of the village attack had forced a clarity he hadn't found in the structured training.</p>
            <p>He closed his eyes, the images of the Flame Serpent, the Ice Tiger, and the Phantom Crow swirling in his mind. The serpent's fluid evasion, the tiger's explosive power, the crow's ability to sense and manipulate the unseen. They weren't just beasts; they were embodiments of martial principles. And the scrolls... they weren't just techniques to be copied, but whispers of a deeper truth, a connection to the very essence of combat.</p>
            <p>He touched the incomplete scroll again. This time, the visions were not chaotic flashes, but clear streams of energy, converging and diverging. The missing piece wasn't a lost technique, but a synthesis. A new form. His form.</p>
