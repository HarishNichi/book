EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF KANJIRAM ACADEMY – EARLY MORNING

A teenager, lean but determined, swings a heavy wooden staff, practicing alone against a tree. His clothes are worn, hands calloused. It's ANIRUDH, now 15.

VILLAGER (O.S.)
Oi! You’ll break that poor tree before you break into that academy.

ANIRUDH
(grinning)
Then I’ll break both.

A group of kids walk by, laughing mockingly.

BULLY BOY
You? Join the Kanjiram Academy? Maybe as a cleaner!

ANIRUDH
One day, I’ll stand where the champions do.

He turns back to the tree, focused.
