    <h1>Child of the Crimson Pendant - Page 23</h1>

    <div class="scene">
        <p>Despite the solid hit, the masked instructor recovered swiftly, their movements economical and precise. They pressed their advantage, forcing Anirudh onto the defensive once more. Anirudh, his chest heaving, parried and dodged, the sting of his bruises a constant reminder of the trial's toll. His vision swam slightly, but his focus remained razor-sharp.</p>

        <p>He knew he couldn't match the instructor's raw power or sustained technique. His only chance was to survive, to last until the end of the round. Every block, every sidestep, was a victory in itself. The instructor landed a glancing blow to his shoulder, sending a jolt of pain through him, but Anirudh grit his teeth and kept moving.</p>

        <p>The seconds stretched into an eternity. The crowd's murmurs had died down, replaced by a hushed anticipation. They watched the worn-out orphan stubbornly refusing to fall before the seasoned instructor. The clang of wood on wood, the ragged breaths of the fighters, were the only sounds.</p>

        <p>Then, a clear, sharp bell RANG through the arena.</p>

        <p>A collective sigh went through the crowd. The allotted time for the combat trial had expired. The masked instructor ceased their attack, stepping back with a controlled grace. Anirudh dropped his staff, his arms trembling, and leaned forward, hands on his knees, trying to catch his breath.</p>

        <p>He hadn't defeated the instructor, not outright. But he had endured. He had faced a master and not been broken. He had lasted the full duration.</p>
