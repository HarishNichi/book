EXT. STONE ARENA – TRIAL FIELD – DAY

Fifty students are placed in a massive circle. The Trial of Initiation begins—a gauntlet of endurance, agility, and power. Many fall. Anirudh keeps going—bleeding, bruised, determined.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Only the top ten may enter Kanjiram Academy.

Final challenge: Defeat a masked instructor in hand-to-hand combat. Anirudh steps forward, exhausted.

INSTRUCTOR (masked)
You should’ve quit, orphan.

ANIRUDH
Orphans fight harder. We have more to prove.

He fights back hard, clever, unpredictable—though not strong, his instinct shines. He lands a hit. The instructor stumbles. Gasps erupt.
