        <h2>The Orphan's Shadow - Page 19</h2>

        <p>The masked instructor moved with a fluid, practiced grace that spoke of years of dedicated training. Every block, every strike was delivered with controlled power. Anirudh, already weary from the preceding trials, found himself immediately on the defensive. The instructor's fists and feet were blurs, aimed with unnerving accuracy.</p>

        <p>Anirudh parried a powerful kick with his forearms, the impact sending a jolt up his arms. He stumbled back, his breath catching in his throat. This was a different level of opponent entirely. The instructor pressed their advantage, a flurry of strikes forcing Anirudh to weave and duck, his movements less about offense and more about sheer survival.</p>

        <p>He watched the instructor's eyes behind the mask, searching for tells, for subtle shifts in weight or muscle tension that would betray their next move. His mind raced, not with fear, but with the desperate need to anticipate, to survive long enough to find an opening. The stone arena floor felt hard beneath his worn boots as he desperately tried to stay one step ahead of the relentless assault.</p>

        <p>The instructor feinted left, then struck right, a quick jab aimed at his ribs. Anirudh twisted away just in time, the blow grazing his side but not connecting cleanly. He could feel the strain in his muscles, the exhaustion pulling at him, but the fire ignited by the instructor's taunts burned bright, refusing to let him yield.</p>
