        <h2>Page 1 – Opening Scene: The Storm</h2>
        <p class="setting">INT. VILLAGE HUT – NIGHT</p>

        <p>The wind howls like a banshee, tearing at the flimsy walls of the hut. Rain lashes down with a relentless fury, a drumming on the thatched roof that threatens to cave it in. Inside, the air is thick with the smell of damp earth and fear. Water seeps through cracks in the mud walls, forming muddy rivulets on the packed dirt floor. A single, flickering oil lamp casts long, dancing shadows.</p>

        <p class="character">WOMAN</p>
        <p class="dialogue">(whispers, her voice raw with tears) Anirudh... my little warrior. Forgive me... Forgive me for bringing you into this storm, into this world of shadows... forgive me that I cannot protect you any longer.</p>

        <p class="action">Her trembling fingers reach for a thin, copper chain around her neck. Attached is a pendant, not ornate, but heavy with a strange, ancient power. It is circular, made of the same dark, aged copper, and etched deeply into its surface is a complex, swirling alchemical symbol. As she holds it, the symbol pulses with a faint, ethereal golden light that seems to defy the surrounding darkness.</p>
        <p class="action">With agonizing effort, she slips the chain over the baby’s head, the cool metal resting against his soft skin. The glowing symbol seems to momentarily brighten as it touches him.</p>

        <p class="character">WOMAN (V.O.)</p>
        <p class="dialogue">Your father’s blood flows through you, little one. The blood of the Alchemist King. They hunt it... they will hunt you. But you must live... you must survive... even if I cannot watch you grow, even if I cannot hold you again...</p>
