            <h3>Round 1: Anirudh vs Garo, The Twin Blade Monk</h3>
            <p>The roar of the crowd was a physical force as Anirudh stepped into the arena. The air crackled with anticipation. This was the Grand Tournament of Rising Suns, a proving ground for warriors from every corner of the land. The prize: entry into the fabled Realm of Masters.</p>
            <p>His first opponent was Garo, a monk whose speed was legendary. They called him "The Twin Blade Monk," and his movements were said to be a blur, his twin daggers appearing and disappearing as if by magic.</p>
            <p>As the gong sounded, Garo was instantly in motion, a whirlwind of steel. Anirudh, remembering Arjun's lessons, centered himself. Speed wasn't just about physical movement; it was about prediction, about seeing the ripples in the energy of his opponent.</p>
            <p>He used the echo-foot technique he had refined in the forest trials, each step a subtle shift in weight and balance that allowed him to anticipate Garo's next strike before it even began.</p>
