            <p>The sudden cold of the stone floor jolted Elara awake. Her head throbbed, a dull ache behind her eyes, and her limbs felt heavy and unresponsive. Slowly, she pushed herself up, her surroundings coming into blurry focus. She was in a small, damp cell, the air thick with the scent of mildew and something else, something faintly metallic, like dried blood or ancient magic.</p>
            <p>Panic, cold and sharp, pricked at her. How had she gotten here? The last thing she remembered was the blinding flash of light, the sudden, jarring silence after the roar of the collapsed tunnel. Had they been captured? Were the others... were they alive?</p>
            <p>She scrambled to the barred door, her hands gripping the cold iron. Outside, a dimly lit corridor stretched in both directions, lined with similar cells. The silence was unnerving, broken only by the occasional drip of water from somewhere in the darkness.</p>
            <p>A faint sound reached her ears then, a soft groan from the cell next to hers. Hope, fragile but persistent, flickered within her. "Hello?" she whispered, her voice hoarse.</p>
            <p>A moment of silence, and then a weak voice replied, "Elara? Is that you?"</p>
            <p>It was Kael. Relief washed over her, so potent it made her knees weak. "Kael! You're alive!"</p>
            <p>His groan came again. "For now. Feels like a rockslide landed on my chest."</p>
            <p>Despite the grim circumstances, a small, watery smile touched Elara's lips. Trust Kael to find humor even in a prison cell. "Are you hurt badly?"</p>
            <p>"Nothing a good bone-healer can't fix, I hope. Where are we?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know," Elara admitted, peering into the dim corridor again. "Some kind of prison, it looks like. Are the others... are they here too?"</p>
            <p>Silence stretched between them for a long moment before Kael's voice returned, heavy with a weariness that chilled Elara to the bone. "I don't know, Elara. I haven't heard or seen anyone else."</p>
            <p>The fragile hope she had clung to began to fray at the edges. If Kael, who was usually quick to assess their surroundings, hadn't seen or heard anyone else, did that mean they were the only survivors?</p>
            <p>She pressed her face against the cold bars, straining to see further down the corridor. The darkness seemed to press in on them, vast and indifferent. They were alone, trapped, with no idea where they were or what their captors wanted.</p>
            <p>A new wave of fear, colder and deeper than before, washed over her. They had faced dangers before, fought against monstrous creatures and treacherous landscapes, but this... this felt different. They were at the mercy of something unseen, something that had managed to capture them so easily.</p>
            <p>She sank back onto the cold floor, pulling her knees to her chest. The metallic scent in the air seemed stronger now, cloying and unsettling. It was the smell of a place that held secrets, a place where forgotten things lingered in the shadows.</p>
            <p>What was this place? And what fate awaited them within its walls?</p>
