            <h2>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h2>
            <h3>Scene 7: Rebirth of Will</h3>
            <p>Anirudh stood before the entrance to the mountain cave, the same cave where his journey with Arjun had truly begun. The air here felt different tonight – charged, expectant. The incomplete scroll on the death-style resurrection technique was clutched in his hand. Before, it had been a source of frustration, a tantalizing glimpse of power he couldn't grasp. Now, after facing the raw, unbridled fear in his hometown, something had clicked.</p>
            <p>The chaos, the desperation, the need to protect others – it had stripped away the layers of expectation and the weight of his father's legacy. He wasn't trying to be his father, or even Arjun. He was just... Anirudh. And in that acceptance, a new understanding bloomed.</p>
            <p>He unrolled the scroll again, the cryptic symbols no longer alien but strangely familiar. He remembered the fluid evasion taught by Arjun, the explosive power of the Flame Serpent he had defeated, the silent focus of the Ice Tiger, and the subtle energy manipulation learned from the Phantom Crow. They weren't separate lessons, but pieces of a larger puzzle.</p>
            <p>Taking a deep breath, Anirudh closed his eyes. He felt the energy within him, not as a rigid force to be controlled, but as a flowing current. He began to move, his body recalling the forms and movements he had learned, not in rote imitation, but with a newfound intuition. The wind steps weren't just about dodging; they were about channeling air itself. The water style wasn't just about deflection; it was about adapting and overcoming. He was weaving them together, creating something new, something that felt inherently *his*.</p>
