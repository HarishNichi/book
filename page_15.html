    <h2>The Trial Grounds - The Final Stretch</h2>
    <p class="narration">The relentless trials had taken their toll. The once-crowded arena was now sparse, fifty hopefuls whittled down to a weary few. Every face was etched with exhaustion, streaked with dirt and sweat, but eyes still burned with a desperate fire. The air, thick with the scent of dust and exertion, crackled with anticipation.</p>

    <p class="narration">Above the arena, a booming voice echoed, amplified by unseen arts.</p>

    <p class="character">ANNOUNCER (V.O.)</p>
    <p class="dialogue">"Hear ye, hear ye! The Trial of Initiation nears its conclusion. Many have fallen, but the path remains open for the truly worthy. Remember the ultimate goal: only the top ten candidates will be granted entry into the esteemed Kanjiram Academy!"</p>

    <p class="narration">A collective intake of breath swept through the remaining students. Top ten. The number hung in the air, a tangible barrier between dreams and harsh reality. Hope warred with fierce rivalry in their tired eyes. Some cast wary glances at those beside them, silently assessing the competition. Anirudh, though battered, straightened slightly, his gaze fixed ahead. Ten spots. That was all he needed.</p>
