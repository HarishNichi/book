    <h1>The Orphan's Shadow - Page 25</h1>

    <p>INT. ACADEMY – DORMITORY – NIGHT</p>

    <p>The silence of the dormitory pressed in on Anirudh. It wasn't the comfortable silence of peace, but the hollow echo of being alone. He was in. He had survived the brutal trials, pushed his battered body beyond its limits, and earned a place within the hallowed walls of Kanjiram Academy.</p>

    <p>But he was utterly, completely alone.</p>

    <p>He lay on the narrow, stiff bunk, the rough wool blanket doing little to soothe his aching muscles. Every breath was a dull throb in his ribs, every movement a fresh complaint from his bruised limbs. The bandages felt tight against his skin, a physical reminder of the price of entry.</p>

    <p>His hand, calloused and scraped, instinctively went to his neck. His fingers closed around the smooth, cool surface of the copper pendant. The strange alchemical symbol etched into it felt familiar under his touch, a constant, silent companion in a world that offered him none.</p>

    <p>He thought of the faces from the trial – the disdainful sneers of the noble-born, the masked anonymity of the instructor, the sheer number of hopefuls who had fallen short. He hadn't made friends. He hadn't sought them. His focus had been singular: survive, succeed, get in.</p>

    <p>And he had.</p>

    <p>A wave of exhaustion, bone-deep and heavy, washed over him. He closed his eyes, the images of the day flickering behind his eyelids. The punishing obstacles, the sneering bully, the surprising burst of adrenaline in the final fight.</p>

    <p>He clutched the pendant tighter. It was more than just a piece of metal. It was a connection to a past he didn't remember, a mystery he yearned to unravel. It was a promise of something more, something that perhaps explained the strange feeling he sometimes had – a flicker of something ancient and powerful just beneath the surface of his skin.</p>

    <p>He was in the academy, yes. But this wasn't the end. It was just the beginning of a different kind of fight. And he was ready.</p>
