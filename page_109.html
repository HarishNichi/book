            <h2>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h2>
            <h3>Scene: Rebirth of Will</h3>
            <p>Anirudh, back in the quiet solitude of the mountain cave, felt a profound shift. The sting of defeat still lingered, but it was tempered by the hard-won lessons of his village's defense. The raw fear he'd faced there, the necessity of calm, decisive action over impulsive rage – it had cleared his mind in ways the arena never could.</p>
            <p>He picked up the incomplete scroll again, the one titled “To Rise, First Die.” Before, it felt like cryptic, impossible instructions. Now, he saw not just words, but the underlying energy flows, the principles of transformation. He remembered the fluid evasion of the Flame Serpent, the grounded power of the Ice Tiger, and the ethereal, almost invisible movement of the Phantom Crow.</p>
            <p>The scroll wasn't about literal death and resurrection. It was about the death of the old self, the inherited expectations, and the rebirth of something new, something uniquely his.</p>
