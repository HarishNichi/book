            <h1>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h1>
            <h2>Scene 8: The Master's Acknowledgment</h2>
            <p>INT. HIDDEN DOJO - SUNSET</p>
            <p>Arjun watched Anirudh. There was a stillness about the young man now, a quiet power that hadn't been there before. The raw edge of youthful ambition had been honed by hardship and introspection.</p>
            <p>ARJUN</p>
            <p>(softly)</p>
            <p>You have surpassed my teachings, Anirudh.</p>
            <p>Anirudh met Arjun's gaze, his expression calm and centered.</p>
            <p>ANIRUDH</p>
            <p>Not surpassed. Only accepted who I am.</p>
            <p>A faint smile touched Arjun's lips. He understood. Anirudh was no longer trying to emulate his father or follow Arjun's path; he had found his own.</p>
