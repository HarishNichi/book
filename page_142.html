            <h3>Scene 8: The Master's Acknowledgment (Continued)</h3>
            <p>Anirudh felt a profound shift. It wasn't just about techniques anymore; it was about embodying his own power, his own truth. The Vayu Vajra wasn't a copy, but a creation, born from his trials and his will to rise.</p>
            <p>Arjun's gaze held a mix of pride and something deeper - a recognition of a journey completed, and a new one beginning.</p>
