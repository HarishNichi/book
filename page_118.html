            <h2>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h2>
            <h3>Scene: Rebirth of Will</h3>
            <p>Anirudh, back in the silent heart of the mountain cave, felt a profound shift. The chaotic visions, the echoes of lost battles, the sting of his defeat against Rudrak, even the terror in his hometown – it all converged into a single, crystalline understanding.</p>
            <p>The incomplete scroll, "To Rise, First Die," no longer felt like a cryptic riddle. The 'death' wasn't physical. It was the death of expectation, the death of trying to embody his father's legacy or perfectly mimic Arjun's teachings.</p>
            <p>He closed his eyes, the energy of the three beasts he'd faced – the fiery serpent, the icy tiger, the elusive crow – swirling within him. He didn't try to separate them, to learn just one style. Instead, he allowed them to blend, to fuse, guided by the core of his own evolving spirit.</p>
            <p>Fluid evasion like the wind, honed by Arjun. Precision strikes, cold and focused, like the tiger. Explosive power, sudden and devastating, like the serpent's flame. And woven through it all, the adaptability and unpredictability of the crow.</p>
            <p>From this crucible of experience and introspection, a new form began to take shape. Not borrowed, not inherited. This was his own.</p>
            <p>He named it in a soft whisper that echoed slightly in the cavern: "Vayu Vajra." The Wind Thunder Form.</p>
