            <h1>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h1>
            <h2>Scene 8: The Master's Acknowledgment (Continued)</h2>
            <p>Arjun watched Anirudh, a faint smile gracing his lips. The boy had endured, had questioned, and in doing so, had forged his own path. He hadn't just learned techniques; he had internalized the spirit of the journey itself. The Whispering Scrolls had offered ancient wisdom, the animal trials had tested his limits, and the tournament had shown him the sting of defeat. Each challenge had been a stepping stone, leading him to this moment.</p>
            <p>Anirudh stood straighter now, not with defiance, but with a quiet confidence. The shadow of his father no longer loomed so large. He was Anirudh, a warrior sculpted by his own experiences, guided but not defined by his lineage. His "Vayu Vajra" form felt like an extension of himself, fluid yet formidable, a testament to his unique evolution.</p>
            <p>Arjun stepped forward, his movement silent as always. He didn't need to speak; his presence was acknowledgment enough. Anirudh met his gaze, a shared understanding passing between them. The dynamic had shifted. It was no longer purely master and student, but something deeper, a recognition of shared purpose and respect.</p>
