            <p>INT. HIDDEN DOJO - SUNSET</p>

            <p>ARJUN<br>
            (softly)<br>
            You have surpassed my teachings, Anirudh.</p>

            <p>ANIRUDH<br>
            Not surpassed. Only accepted who I am.</p>

            <p>Arjun bows. Not as a master to a student—but as equals.</p>

            <p>A new invitation arrives. “War Council of Realms”—an elite gathering where his father was once betrayed.</p>

            <p>Anirudh opens it. His path leads next to uncover the truth behind his birth—and face ancient enemies.</p>
