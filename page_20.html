        <p>The masked instructor pressed their attack, a whirlwind of practiced strikes and blocks. Anirudh, though weary and outmatched in raw power, wasn't fighting a conventional battle. He wasn't trying to overpower; he was trying to outthink, to flow like water around the unyielding rock of the instructor's technique.</p>

        <p>His movements were less about force and more about angles, about finding the subtle shifts in the instructor's weight, the brief moments of imbalance. He parried not with a solid block, but with a redirecting flick of his wrist, sending the instructor's punch just wide. He dodged not by stepping back, but by weaving *into* the attack, forcing the instructor to adjust mid-motion, creating a momentary lapse in their guard.</p>

        <p>It was ugly, unorthodox, and utterly effective in disrupting the instructor's rhythm. He saw an opening – a fraction of a second as the instructor shifted their weight for a heavy kick. Instead of retreating, Anirudh darted forward, lower than expected, using his smaller frame to his advantage. He didn't block the kick; he ducked under it, simultaneously sweeping his leg out low. It wasn't a powerful sweep, but it caught the back of the instructor's ankle, just enough to buckle their knee.</p>

        <p>The instructor stumbled, a grunt of surprise escaping their mask. Gasps rippled through the onlookers – the orphan had actually landed a hit! It wasn't a knockout blow, not by a long shot, but it was a breach in the instructor's impenetrable defense, a testament to Anirudh's scrappy, unpredictable fighting style.</p>
