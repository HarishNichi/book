            <h2>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h2>
            <h3>Scene: Village in Peril (continued)</h3>
            <p>The air crackled with dark energy as the corrupted creatures swarmed the village outskirts. Their forms were twisted, eyes glowing with an unnatural malice. The villagers, armed with pitchforks and fear, stood little chance against such unnatural foes.</p>
            <p>Anirudh surveyed the chaos. His gut instinct screamed to unleash the raw power he had cultivated. Rage threatened to cloud his judgment, the desire to protect his home warring with the lessons of calm and calculated action Arjun had instilled.</p>
            <p>"This is not an arena," Arjun's voice echoed in his mind. "In the real world, calm judgment saves lives, not just wins battles."</p>
            <p>Taking a deep breath, Anirudh pushed back the tide of anger. He needed to think, to use his newfound understanding of energy and movement not just for offense, but for defense, for strategy.</p>
