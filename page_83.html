                <p>The air in the mountain cave was cold and still, a stark contrast to the frantic energy that had consumed him in the village. Anirudh sat cross-legged, the incomplete scroll laid out before him. Days had passed since the attack, days spent helping rebuild, tending to the wounded, and reflecting. The raw fear he had faced, the responsibility of protecting others, had stripped away the layers of ego and ambition that had driven him in the arena.</p>
                <p>He looked at the scroll titled "To Rise, First Die" not with frustration at its missing parts, but with a newfound clarity. In the heat of battle against the corrupted beasts, his movements had become fluid, instinctive. He hadn't relied on a single style, but a blend of techniques he'd absorbed â€“ the elusive footwork against the fiery attacks, the grounded stance against the earth-shaking charges, the keen awareness of his surroundings against the shadowy pounces.</p>
                <p>It wasn't about mimicking Arjun, or even living up to the legend of his father. It was about taking what he had learned, what he had experienced, and forging something new. Something uniquely his own. The whispers of the scrolls echoed in his mind, no longer just glimpses of ancient power, but fragments waiting to be woven together.</p>
