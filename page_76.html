            <p>Rudrak's power was absolute. Every strike landed with the force of a lightning bolt, shaking the very foundation of the arena. Anirudh, despite his newfound skills, was being overwhelmed. He blocked, he dodged, he countered, but Rudrak was a force of nature.</p>

            <p>The crowd roared, a mixture of awe and dread. They had never seen such raw, devastating power. Anirudh felt his energy reserves dwindling, his body aching with each impact.</p>

            <p>Then came the final blow. Rudrak gathered the storm around him, his fist crackling with raw thunder. "Thunder Fist!" he roared, bringing it down with crushing force.</p>

            <p>Anirudh brought up his arms, a desperate attempt to shield himself. The impact was immense, a shockwave that threw him clear across the arena. He hit the far wall with a sickening thud, his vision blurring, the sounds of the crowd fading.</p>

            <p>Darkness claimed him.</p>

            <p>From the shadows, Arjun watched, his face unreadable. "He must fallâ€¦ to rise beyond," he whispered, a flicker of something unidentifiable in his eyes.</p>
