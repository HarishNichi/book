    <p>As Anirudh completed the obstacle course, his chest heaving and his body bruised, he saw a figure standing near the finish line. It was another student, a young man with a haughty expression and clothes that were impeccably clean despite the grueling trial. This was Rohan, son of a renowned general, and a student who embodied the academy's ideals of perfection and discipline.</p>
    <p>Rohan watched Anirudh with a critical gaze, his lip curling in a faint sneer. He had finished the course long before Anirudh, his form flawless, his breathing controlled. He saw Anirudh's struggle, his unorthodox methods, and he was not impressed. He saw not a warrior, but a street rat who had somehow managed to survive.</p>

    <div class="dialogue">Look at him. A disgrace to the trials. He fights like a cornered animal, not a student of the arts.</div>
    <p>Anirudh heard the comment, but he did not react. He was used to the scorn of the privileged. He simply met Rohan's gaze, a silent promise in his eyes. He would not be broken.</p>
