    <h1>The Orphan's Shadow - Page 32</h1>

    <div class="scene">
        <p>Moving with a quiet grace honed by years of necessity, Anirudh slipped through the narrow gap in the bookshelves that marked the entrance to the forbidden section. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of moonlight filtering through a high window. His heart hammered a steady rhythm against his ribs, a mix of trepidation and exhilarating purpose.</p>

        <p>He wasn't here out of idle curiosity. The whispers about his lineage, the strange pendant he wore, the blank space where his past should be – they were constant, gnawing questions. The academy library, with its vast collection, felt like the most likely place to find answers, especially in sections deemed too dangerous or sensitive for the general student body.</p>

        <p>His eyes scanned the spines, searching for anything that hinted at forgotten histories, obscure symbols, or the alchemical arts his pendant seemed connected to. Every shadow felt watchful, every creak of the ancient floorboards a potential alarm. But the need to understand outweighed the risk. He needed to know who he was, and why his mother had given her life for his.</p>

        <p>His fingers traced the worn covers of forbidden tomes, the air thick with the scent of old paper and something else… something faintly metallic, like dried blood or ancient magic.</p>
