    <p>Finally, Elara found it. Tucked away in a dusty corner, she found a small, leather-bound journal. It was the personal diary of the Alchemist King's wife, a powerful sorceress in her own right. The journal spoke of her love for her husband, her fears for their unborn child, and the growing threat of their enemies.</p>
    <p>In the final entry, written in a shaky hand, she described a premonition, a vision of her husband's betrayal and death. She wrote of a desperate plan to save their child, to hide him away with a loyal servant, and to give him the Crimson Pendant, a key to his past and his future.</p>
    <p>The journal ended with a heartbreaking plea: "Find him. Protect him. Tell him that his mother loved him."</p>
