        <p>The Kanjiram Academy main gate looms like a fortress wall carved from ancient, grey stone. Intricate, intimidating symbols are etched into the massive, iron-bound doors, whispering of power and exclusivity. Guards in crisp, dark uniforms stand at attention, their gazes sharp and unwelcoming.</p>

        <p>A long, snaking line of hopefuls stretches back from the gate. Most are teenagers, barely older than Anirudh, but their bearing and attire speak of privilege. Silks, finely woven tunics, and polished leather boots are common. Their skin is unblemished, their hands soft – hands that have never known true hardship.</p>

        <p>Among them, ANIRUDH stands out starkly. His clothes are a patchwork of repaired cotton and faded linen, clean but worn thin in places. His boots are scuffed, his hands calloused from years of labor and self-training. He clutches the familiar copper pendant under his tunic, its faint warmth a secret comfort.</p>

        <p>The noble-born teens eye him with undisguised disdain. Whispers ripple through the line – murmurs of his tattered appearance, his obvious lack of status. They look at him as if he is dirt tracked in from the outside, an unwelcome stain on the pristine image of the academy hopefuls. Their expressions range from polite indifference to outright sneering.</p>

        <p>Anirudh ignores them, focusing on the imposing gate ahead, his jaw set with grim determination. He is here, against all odds, and their looks won't deter him.</p>
