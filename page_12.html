    <h1>Child of the Crimson Pendant - Page 12</h1>

    <div class="scene">
        <p>The Trial pressed on, relentless. After the grueling endurance and twisting agility courses, the test shifted. Now, it was a display of raw power. Massive, unworked stones lay scattered across a section of the arena. The challenge: move the largest stone you could a set distance using only physical force or rudimentary energy projection, a basic skill many noble-born students had trained in since childhood.</p>

        <p>Groans and grunts filled the air. Muscled youths strained, veins bulging in their necks as they attempted to heave the massive rocks. Sparks of weak, uncontrolled energy flickered from the hands of others, failing to budge the heaviest stones more than an inch.</p>

        <p>Anirudh watched, assessing. He knew he couldn't compete with their inherited strength or years of energy training. His arms were lean, his energy control non-existent in the conventional sense they taught. But his mind was sharp, honed by years of needing to be resourceful just to survive.</p>

        <p>He didn't approach the largest stone. Instead, he moved towards a slightly smaller, though still considerable, boulder nestled near a slight incline in the arena floor. While others focused on raw pushing, Anirudh studied the stone's shape, the ground around it, looking for an advantage.</p>

        <p>He found it â€“ a subtle leverage point. He positioned his staff, not to strike, but to wedge it beneath a lip of the stone. Then, using his body weight and the slight downhill angle, he applied pressure, a calculated push and pivot rather than a brute-force heave. The stone groaned, then slowly, incrementally, began to roll. It wasn't fast, it wasn't powerful-looking like the explosive bursts from others, but it was effective. He guided it, using the terrain and his staff as a lever, moving it further than several who had attempted the larger stones with only muscle.</p>

        <p>A few onlookers, who had initially scoffed at his choice of stone, exchanged surprised glances. Anirudh ignored them, focused solely on the task, sweat dripping, every muscle burning, but a flicker of satisfaction in his eyes. He wasn't the strongest, but he was proving he was smart.</p>
