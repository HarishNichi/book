        <h2>EXT. STONE ARENA – TRIAL FIELD – DAY</h2>
        <p class="narration">The air crackles with nervous energy. Fifty young hopefuls, arranged in a vast stone circle under the watchful eyes of the academy instructors, await the start of the Trial of Initiation. The arena itself is intimidating – ancient stones worn smooth by time and countless challenges, surrounded by tiers where senior students and a few curious townsfolk have gathered to observe.</p>

        <p class="narration">A harsh voice echoes across the arena.</p>

        <div class="character">ANNOUNCER (O.S.)</div>
        <div class="dialogue">"The Trial of Initiation begins! Prove your worth! Only the strongest, the fastest, the most resilient shall pass!"</div>

        <p class="narration">The first challenge is revealed: an grueling test of endurance. A long, winding obstacle course designed to push bodies to their absolute limits. Walls to scale, weighted carries, treacherous balance beams, and a relentless pace set by the instructors.</p>

        <p class="narration">Chaos erupts as the hopefuls surge forward. Immediately, the strain begins to show. Privileged youths, unused to such physical hardship, falter and collapse. Gasps and groans fill the air as muscles scream and lungs burn.</p>

        <p class="narration">Anirudh is not the fastest, nor the strongest in pure brute force, but his movements are efficient, born of years of hardship and self-reliance. He pushes through the pain, his eyes locked forward. He scrapes his knee scrambling over a rough stone wall, a crimson trail marking his effort. His hands, already calloused, are rubbed raw by the weighted rope. A misstep on a wobbly beam sends him stumbling, a sharp bruise forming on his hip.</p>

        <p class="narration">He sees others give up, their spirits broken. He hears the murmurs from the onlookers – disappointment, indifference. But he presses on. Every ache, every cut, every moment of exhaustion only fuels his resolve. This is what he trained for, what he endured for. He remembers the sneers at the gate, the whispers of 'orphan'. He will not fail.</p>

        <p class="narration">He is bleeding, he is bruised, his breath comes in ragged gasps, but he keeps moving. One foot in front of the other. He is not just running a race; he is fighting for his life.</p>
