        <h1>The Tournament of Rising Suns</h1>
        <p>The arena roared. Garo, the Twin Blade Monk, was a whirlwind of steel. His twin blades moved with a terrifying speed, a silver blur against the sun-drenched sand.</p>
        <p>Anirudh, remembering Arjun's lessons, focused on his breathing, centering himself amidst the chaos. He didn't try to meet Garo's speed head-on. Instead, he used the echo-foot technique, a subtle shift in weight and timing that allowed him to anticipate Garo's next move.</p>
        <p>With each predicted movement, Anirudh would elegantly sidestep, the blades whistling past him by inches. Garo, unused to his attacks being nullified before they landed, grew frustrated.</p>
        <p>Anirudh saw his opening. As Garo committed to a wide, sweeping arc with both blades, Anirudh used his energy sensing to predict the exact moment of vulnerability. He moved in a blur, not of speed, but of precise, calculated movement.</p>
        <p>A single, swift strike with the edge of his hand connected with Garo's wrist, forcing him to drop one blade with a clatter. Before Garo could recover, Anirudh delivered a clean, powerful palm strike to the monk's chest, sending him staggering back and out of the ring.</p>
        <p>"Winner! Anirudh!" the announcer's voice boomed, lost slightly in the cheers of the crowd.</p>
