            <h3>Scene 8: The Master's Acknowledgment</h3>
            <p>The air in the hidden dojo was thick with the scent of ancient wood and fading sunlight. Arjun stood, his posture relaxed yet radiating an undeniable power. Anirudh faced him, his own stance grounded, his breath even.</p>
            <p>There were no more forms to practice, no more techniques to refine. Their exchange had transcended physical movement, becoming a silent conversation of energy and understanding.</p>
            <p>Finally, Arjun spoke, his voice soft, carrying the weight of years of wisdom.</p>
            <p>ARJUN</p>
            <p>(softly)</p>
            <p>You have surpassed my teachings, Anirudh.</p>
            <p>Anirudhâ€™s gaze was steady, a quiet strength in his eyes.</p>
            <p>ANIRUDH</p>
            <p>Not surpassed. Only accepted who I am.</p>
