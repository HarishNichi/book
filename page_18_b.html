    <p>Working together, Anirudh and Rohan managed to navigate the treacherous forest. Anirudh's knowledge of the wild and his ability to read the subtle signs of magic, combined with Rohan's polished combat skills, made them a formidable team. They found the hidden banner just as the sun was setting.</p>
    <p>As they made their way back to the academy, a fragile truce had formed between them. Rohan was still arrogant, but he now had a grudging respect for Anirudh's abilities. Anirudh, in turn, saw that beneath Rohan's pride, there was a capable warrior.</p>
    <p>They returned to the academy, victorious. They had not become friends, but they were no longer just rivals. They were two young men who had learned to respect each other's strengths, a lesson that would prove to be more valuable than any victory in the trials.</p>
