                <h3>Scene 8: The Master's Acknowledgment (continued)</h3>
                <p>Arjun’s eyes, ancient and deep, held a flicker of something Anirudh hadn’t seen before – not pride, not just acceptance, but a quiet recognition of a journey completed and a new one beginning. The setting sun painted the hidden dojo in hues of orange and purple, casting long shadows that danced with the dust motes in the air.</p>

                <p>Anirudh stood tall, the weariness of the tournament and the subsequent village battle etched onto his face, but there was a new stillness in his posture, a centeredness that had been absent before. He no longer felt the burning need to prove himself, to live up to a legacy or an expectation. He had faced his own fears, his own limitations, and in doing so, had found his own strength.</p>

                <p>"Not surpassed," Anirudh repeated, his voice calm and steady. "Only accepted who I am. Accepted the lessons, yes, but woven them into something… something that is mine."</p>

                <p>A faint smile touched Arjun’s lips. It was a rare sight, like the first bloom of a desert flower. "And in accepting yourself, you have indeed surpassed. The greatest mastery is not in wielding techniques, but in understanding one's own spirit."</p>
