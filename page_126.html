            <h2>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h2>
            <h3>Scene 7: Rebirth of Will (Continued)</h3>
            <p>Anirudh stood before the ancient vault once more. The cool air of the secret cavern did little to settle the fire of determination now burning within him. He clutched the incomplete scroll, its cryptic symbols no longer a source of frustration but a challenge, an invitation. He remembered the weight of Rudrak's thunder fist, the bitter taste of defeat, and the chilling realization that his father's legacy was not his own.</p>
            <p>He closed his eyes, his breath slow and even. He recalled the blinding speed of the Flame Serpent, forcing him to master evasive wind steps. He felt the raw power of the Ice Tiger, demanding a mastery of water-style to quench its icy fury. He heard the disorienting cries of the Phantom Crow, which had taught him the stillness of silence meditation to center his energy.</p>
            <p>Each memory, each lesson, was a piece of a larger puzzle. His father's style was fire and earth, Arjun's was wind and shadow. He was not meant to mimic them. He was meant to synthesize, to evolve. The incomplete death-style resurrection technique in the scroll wasn't just about defying death; it was about defying limitation, about rising from the ashes of expectation.</p>
