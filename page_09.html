    <p>EXT. STONE ARENA – TRIAL FIELD – DAY</p>

    <p>The air thrummed with a nervous energy. Fifty hopefuls, a mix of raw talent and privileged entitlement, were herded into the Stone Arena. It was a colossal, circular depression carved into the earth, surrounded by tiered seating that would soon fill with the academy's elite and curious villagers alike.</p>

    <p>The massive circle marked the starting point of the Trial of Initiation. The ground was packed dirt, scarred with the marks of countless past trials. Around the perimeter stood stern-faced instructors, their arms crossed, their gazes sharp and unwavering. The sheer scale of the arena, the weight of the expectations, settled heavily on the shoulders of every student.</p>

    <p>Anirudh stood among them, a stark contrast to the polished armor and fine silks of many of his peers. His simple, worn tunic felt like a statement in itself. He scanned the faces around him, seeing a mixture of fear, arrogance, and a few flickerings of genuine courage. A low murmur rippled through the crowd as the final preparations were made. The Trial of Initiation was about to begin, a gauntlet designed to test not just skill, but spirit.</p>
