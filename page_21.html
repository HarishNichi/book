        <p>The masked instructor, confident and powerful, pressed their attack, a blur of trained movements designed to end the fight swiftly. Anirudh, battered and weary, moved with a different kind of energy â€“ born not of perfect form, but of desperate survival and sharp intuition. He parried a heavy blow, the impact rattling his arm, but instead of retreating, he twisted, using the force of the instructor's own strike to propel himself into a sudden, low sweep.</p>

        <p>It wasn't a move taught in the academy's basic forms. It was messy, unexpected, born of instinct honed on the streets. The instructor, anticipating a block or a dodge, was caught off guard. Anirudh's foot connected sharply with the back of their knee.</p>

        <p>A collective gasp rippled through the gathered students and instructors watching from the sidelines. The masked figure, moments before a picture of unshakeable skill, stumbled. They didn't fall, but the perfect rhythm of their movements was broken. A visible jolt went through their frame, a momentary loss of balance that spoke volumes in this display of dominance.</p>

        <p>Whispers, different from the earlier disdain, began to spread through the crowd. Surprise, confusion, even a grudging flicker of respect crossed some faces. The orphan, the boy with no name, had actually touched the untouchable. He had landed a hit.</p>
