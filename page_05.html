    <div class="narration">
        Anirudh, sweat slicking his forehead, didn't falter in his rhythm, the heavy staff a familiar extension of his will. The villager's words hung in the crisp morning air, a faint echo of a sentiment he'd heard countless times. His grin was genuine, born of sheer, unshakeable resolve.
    </div>

    <div class="narration">
        Just then, a cluster of figures rounded the bend in the dusty road leading toward the academy. They were younger than Anirudh, perhaps twelve or thirteen, but their clothes were impossibly fine – silks and tailored tunics in vibrant colors that spoke of wealth and status. Their faces were clean, their hands smooth, untouched by the grime of labor. A bubble of laughter, high and sharp, preceded them.

    <div class="character">BULLY BOY</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        (Pointing a manicured finger, his voice dripping with scorn)
        Oi! Look who thinks he’s going to rub shoulders with us! You? Join the Kanjiram Academy? Maybe they need someone to muck out the stables, orphan! That’s about your speed.
    </div>

    <div class="narration">
        The other kids snickered, a chorus of cruel amusement. Anirudh felt a familiar clench in his gut, the sting of their contempt a dull ache he had learned to live with. He could feel the heat rising in his cheeks, the impulse to lash out, to prove them wrong right now, a burning ember under his skin. But years of enduring such barbs had taught him a different kind of strength – the strength to swallow the insult and let his actions speak louder.

    <div class="character">ANIRUDH</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        (Meeting the Bully Boy's gaze, his own eyes holding a fire they couldn't extinguish)
        One day, I’ll stand where the champions do. And you’ll be looking up.
    </div>

    <div class="narration">
        He held the gaze for a beat longer than necessary, a silent challenge in his eyes. Then, he turned back to the tree, the weight of the staff a comforting, solid presence in his hands. The laughter of the kids faded as they continued their walk towards the imposing gates of Kanjiram Academy, their mockery a fading whisper against the roar of Anirudh's own quiet determination. His focus narrowed, the tree his immediate adversary, a proxy for the obstacles that lay ahead.
