                <p>Round 2: Anirudh vs Vana, The Sound Bender continued...</p>
                <p>Anirudh pressed on, focusing his mind. Vana's sonic waves distorted the very air, making it hard to see, harder to think. Each concussive blast hammered at his senses, threatening to overwhelm him.</p>
                <p>But Anirudh remembered Arjun's teachings. He closed his eyes for a fleeting moment, not to shut out the sound, but to turn inward. He sought the silence within himself, the calm center amidst the storm of Vana's attack.</p>
                <p>He controlled his breathing, regulated his energy flow. The chaotic vibrations still assailed him, but they no longer found purchase in his core. He was an anchor in a sea of noise.</p>
                <p>Using this newfound control, Anirudh began to anticipate Vana's movements not through sight or sound, but through the subtle shifts in energy her attacks required. It was a deeper form of sensing, less reliant on the outer world and more connected to the flow of power itself.</p>
                <p>He moved with renewed purpose, dodging sonic blasts that a moment ago would have left him reeling. He wasn't just reacting; he was predicting.</p>
