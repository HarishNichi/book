            <p>Anirudh faced the second creature â€“ the Ice Tiger. Its coat shimmered with frost, and its breath turned the air to biting cold. Every movement was precise, calculated to freeze Anirudh in his tracks.</p>

            <p>Remembering the fluidity of water from the scrolls, Anirudh focused his energy, allowing the Ice Tiger's attacks to flow around him like a river around a stone. He didn't meet force with force, but with yielding adaptability.</p>

            <p>The Tiger lunged, ice claws extended. Anirudh, using a technique learned from the scrolls called 'Flowing Current Defense', redirected the momentum, causing the tiger to slide past him. He followed up with a series of strikes designed to disrupt the tiger's icy core, not with brute strength, but with focused pressure points.</p>

            <p>The battle was a dance of ice and water, a test of Anirudh's ability to adapt and overcome. He was learning that true strength wasn't just in power, but in understanding and controlling the elements.</p>
