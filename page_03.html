    <p class="setting">EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF KANJIRAM ACADEMY – EARLY MORNING</p>

    <p>Fifteen years have carved their mark. The crumbling hut of Anirudh's birth is a distant, hazy memory. Now, the crisp, cool air of an early Kanjiram morning bites at the skin. Before the imposing, distant walls of the Kanjiram Academy, on a patch of uneven ground at the edge of the wilder lands, a lone figure trains.</p>

    <p>It is ANIRUDH, now fifteen. His frame is lean, honed by years of hardship and relentless practice. Muscles ripple under his worn, patched tunic as he swings a heavy wooden staff. The staff is rough, unvarnished, its surface splintered in places from countless impacts against trees and rocks. Anirudh moves with a fierce intensity, each swing of the staff a testament to his unwavering resolve. Sweat beads on his brow despite the morning chill. His hands, visible as he grips the staff, are calloused and rough, marked by the work of survival and self-training. His clothes are threadbare, a stark contrast to the fine silks and leathers he imagines within the academy walls.</p>

    <p>He parries imaginary blows, ducks, weaves, and strikes with a surprising agility for someone wielding such a crude weapon. There's a raw, untamed energy in his movements, born not of formal training but of necessity and a desperate yearning for something more. He focuses entirely on the battered trunk of an ancient oak, treating it as a formidable opponent, his jaw set with determination.</p>
