 Anirudh’s gaze was fixed on the War Council seal, a knot tightening in his stomach. He looked up at Arjun, the unspoken question hanging in the air.\n
 <p class="dialogue">ANIRUDH</p>\n
 <p class="dialogue">(voice low)</p>\n
 <p class="dialogue">The War Council of Realms… This is where it happened, wasn\'t it? Where my father…</p>\n+ <p>Arjun’s expression was solemn. He nodded slowly.</p>\n+ <p class="dialogue">ARJUN</p>\n+ <p class="dialogue">Yes. It is. The place of his greatest triumph, and his ultimate betrayal. They summon you, now. A dangerous invitation.</p>\n+ <p>Anirudh looked back at the scroll, the elegant script now seeming to carry a hidden weight, a silent challenge. He thought of his father, the legend, the man betrayed by those he trusted. A fire ignited within him, not of anger, but of resolve.</p>\n+ <p class="dialogue">ANIRUDH</p>\n+ <p class="dialogue">Then I will go. To understand. To uncover the truth. And to face whatever awaits me there.</p>\n+
