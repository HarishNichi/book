            <p>News came, swift and brutal, like a poisoned arrow to the heart. Wild beasts were attacking his hometown. Not the creatures of the Forest of Shadows he had faced in trials, but something far more twisted. Their eyes glowed with an unnatural, sickly light, their forms bloated and distorted. These were creatures corrupted by dark alchemy, instruments of a malevolent force.</p>

            <p>Arjun appeared at his side, his face grim.</p>

            <p>"This is your test, Anirudh," Arjun said, his voice low but firm. "Not in an arena of polished stone and cheering crowds. In the real world. Where the stakes are lives, not glory."</p>

            <p>Anirudh felt a cold dread coil in his gut, but beneath it, a fierce determination ignited. His home. His people. He would not let them fall.</p>

            <p>He turned and ran, the memory of his first defeat still a fresh wound, but now, tempered with a new purpose. He would face this threat, not with the raw, untamed power of his past, but with the calm, learned judgment he had begun to cultivate.</p>
