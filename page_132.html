            <h2>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h2>
            <h3>Scene: Rebirth of Will</h3>
            <p>Anirudh felt the familiar weight of the incomplete scroll in his hands. The words "To Rise, First Die" seemed to shimmer with a new meaning after the raw fear he'd faced defending his home. The abstract concepts now grounded in the desperate struggle against corrupted beasts.</p>
            <p>He closed his eyes, picturing the fluid evasion of the Flame Serpent, the grounded power of the Ice Tiger, and the elusive strikes of the Phantom Crow. They weren't just trials; they were pieces of a puzzle he hadn't fully grasped until now.</p>
            <p>Back in the quiet of the mountain cave, the fragments of the death-style resurrection technique began to coalesce with the martial knowledge from the Whispering Scrolls and the lessons etched into him by Arjun.</p>
