            <h2>Scene 8: The Master's Acknowledgment</h2>
            <p>The air in the hidden dojo was still, the last rays of sunset casting long shadows across the polished floor. Anirudh stood before Arjun, his posture different now – not just a student, but someone who had faced the storm and found his own center within it.</p>
            <p>Arjun’s eyes, usually alight with intensity, were soft with a quiet understanding.</p>
            <p>ARJUN (softly)</p>
