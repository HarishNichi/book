            <p>Anirudh reached out a hand, his fingers trembling slightly as they approached the nearest scroll. It shimmered with an internal light, a soft hum emanating from within. As his fingertip made contact, the scroll reacted instantly. It pulsed with a bright, golden light and seemed to dissolve, flowing into his mind like liquid knowledge.</p>

            <p>Visions flooded his consciousness. He saw warriors of ages past, their forms blurring with impossible speed and power. They moved through landscapes that defied reality, battling foes of terrifying strength. Each image was a fragment of a lost martial style, a glimpse into techniques that had been forgotten by the world outside this hidden cavern.</p>

            <p>He saw a master moving with the fluidity of water, deflecting strikes with effortless grace. Another warrior stood firm as a mountain, his fists capable of shattering stone. There was one who moved like the wind, appearing and disappearing as if by magic. The images came in quick succession, overwhelming his senses, yet leaving a strange sense of familiarity, as if he had always known these movements, these forms.</p>

            <p>The light subsided, leaving Anirudh breathless but unharmed. The scroll was gone, its knowledge now etched into his memory, a part of him. He looked at Arjun, his eyes wide with a mixture of awe and confusion.</p>
