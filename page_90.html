                <p>Arjun bowed. Not as a master to a student, but as equals. A profound silence settled between them, filled with unspoken respect and the understanding of a shared, arduous path. Anirudh felt a warmth spread through him, a sense of validation that went deeper than any victory in the arena.</p>
                <p>The air shifted, a subtle change that drew both their attention. A messenger bird, its feathers shimmering with arcane energy, flew in through an open window. It landed gracefully on a nearby perch, a small, elegantly folded scroll tied to its leg.</p>
                <p>Anirudh reached out and carefully untied the scroll. The parchment felt ancient, imbued with a power that hummed beneath his fingertips. Unfurling it, he saw a formal seal he recognized from his father's old texts â€“ the mark of the War Council of Realms.</p>
                <p>The invitation was concise, yet its implications were vast. An elite gathering of the most powerful figures from across the realms, a council where alliances were forged and destinies decided. It was also the very place where his father had met his betrayal.</p>
