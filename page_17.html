    <h1>Child of the Crimson Pendant - Page 17</h1>

    <p>Anirudh faced the masked instructor. The figure was cloaked, their face hidden behind a plain, expressionless mask. Their stance was solid, radiating a quiet, confident power that felt heavy in the air. Anirudh felt the weight of the day's trials in every aching muscle, but a different kind of energy, a stubborn fire, burned within him.</p>

    <p>The instructor tilted their head slightly, their voice low and tinged with what sounded like weary amusement.</p>

    <p>"You made it this far," the masked instructor said, their voice a low rumble that seemed to echo slightly within the confines of the arena. "Didn't expect an orphan to have such... tenacity."</p>

    <p>The words, delivered with a deliberate casualness, struck Anirudh. He felt the familiar sting of that label, the dismissiveness that always accompanied it. Around the edges of the arena, he could hear faint, suppressed snickers from some of the other students who had already completed or failed the trials.</p>

    <p>Anirudh's jaw tightened, but he didn't flinch. He met the masked instructor's unseen gaze with a steady, defiant look.</p>
