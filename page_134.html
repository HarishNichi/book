            <h2>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h2>
            <h3>Scene 8: The Master's Acknowledgment</h3>
            <p>INT. HIDDEN DOJO - SUNSET</p>

            <p>Anirudh stood opposite Arjun in the fading light of the dojo. There were no forms practiced today, no lessons given. Just a quiet contemplation in the air.</p>

            <p>ARJUN<br>(softly)<br>You have surpassed my teachings, Anirudh.</p>

            <p>Anirudh looked at his mentor, a faint smile touching his lips.</p>

            <p>ANIRUDH<br>Not surpassed. Only accepted who I am.</p>

            <p>Arjun's eyes held a depth of understanding. He lowered his head slightly, a gesture not of a master to a student, but of equals acknowledging a shared path, a shared respect.</p>

            <p>A heavy silence settled between them, filled with unspoken history and a profound connection forged through trials and shared purpose.</p>
