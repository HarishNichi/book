    <h2>Child of the Crimson Pendant - Page 8</h2>

    <p class="narration">INT. KANJIRAM ACADEMY – MAIN GATE – DAY (CONTINUOUS)</p>

    <p class="narration">The whispers continued, a low, venomous hum surrounding Anirudh. Orphan. Untitled. Worthless. The words stung, but they also ignited something cold and hard within him. He met the Instructor’s gaze, his jaw set.</p>

    <div class="character">INSTRUCTOR</div>
    <p class="dialogue">We’ll see if you survive the Trials.</p>

    <p class="narration">The Instructor's words were a dismissal, a challenge, and a confirmation of the prejudice that permeated the air. Anirudh didn't flinch. He didn't respond verbally. Instead, he held the Instructor's gaze for a fraction of a second longer than expected, a silent promise in his eyes.</p>

    <p class="narration">Let them whisper. Let them doubt. Their scorn was fuel. He would not just survive the Trials; he would conquer them. Every dismissive glance, every whispered insult, was another reason to push harder, to fight smarter, to prove them all spectacularly wrong. The copper pendant felt cool against his skin, a small, constant weight and a reminder of the unknown legacy he carried. He turned, his shoulders back, and walked towards the holding area for the trial participants, the weight of their judgment a heavy cloak he was determined to shed through sheer will and skill.</p>
