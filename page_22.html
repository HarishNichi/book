    <h1>Child of the Crimson Pendant - Page 22</h1>

    <p>The masked instructor stumbled back, a sharp intake of breath audible even through the concealing fabric.  It wasn't a fall, not a defeat, but it was a clear sign that Anirudh's unexpected strike had landed true.  The instructor paused for a brief moment, straightening their posture, a subtle shift in their stance suggesting a regaining of composure, perhaps even a spark of something akin to grudging respect behind the impassive mask.  The air in the arena crackled with surprise.</p>

    <p>A wave of gasps swept through the gathered students and instructors watching from the sidelines. Murmurs rippled through the crowd, growing louder. "Did you see that?" "The orphan actually landed a hit!" "He's not just flailing..." Their voices were hushed, filled with disbelief and a grudging acknowledgment of the impossible. They had come expecting to see the nameless boy quickly dispatched, another failed applicant, but Anirudh, bruised and weary, was proving them all wrong.</p>

    <p>The masked instructor settled back into a fighting stance, their movements fluid and controlled once more, but the brief falter, the almost imperceptible pause, had been seen by everyone. The fight was far from over, but the narrative had shifted. The impossible had just become a fleeting, stunning reality.</p>
