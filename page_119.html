            <h2>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h2>
            <h3>Scene 7: Rebirth of Will (Continued)</h3>
            <p>Anirudh stood before the ancient vault once more. The Whispering Scrolls remained, silent now, their secrets absorbed. He held the incomplete resurrection technique scroll, the one titled “To Rise, First Die.” In the aftermath of his defeat and the village's peril, the fragmented instructions began to make sense. The death it spoke of was not physical, but the death of his past self, the shadow of his father, the rage that had once consumed him.</p>
            <p>He closed his eyes, recalling the movements of the Flame Serpent, the stillness of the Ice Tiger, the elusive flight of the Phantom Crow. Not just their physical forms, but the essence of their power. Fire's raw energy, Ice's unyielding defense, and Crow's adaptability. He saw how they could intertwine, not as separate styles, but as components of something new.</p>
            <p>He began to move, tentatively at first, then with growing confidence. Fluid evasion like the wind, precise strikes like lightning, and explosive bursts of power born from the combined essence of the beasts. This was not his father's thunder style, nor Arjun's wind techniques. It was his own.</p>
