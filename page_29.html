        <h2>Page 29 – A Small Victory</h2>
        <p class="narration">The Instructor's voice faded, leaving behind the quiet buzz of the dormitory. Anirudh lay still for a moment, the words echoing in his mind. Tenth. He, the orphan, the one with no name, no backing, no privilege – he had made it. The pain in his bruised ribs and aching muscles was a dull throb compared to the surge of triumph that warmed him from the inside out.</p>
        <p class="narration">Slowly, a small, almost imperceptible smile broke across his lips. It wasn't a wide, joyous grin, but a tight, quiet curve of satisfaction. This smile held the weight of fifteen years of struggle, of countless cold nights and empty bellies, of being mocked and dismissed. It was a smile that said, 'You told me I couldn't. But I did.'</p>
        <p class="narration">He had proven the villagers wrong, the arrogant noble-born teens wrong, even that masked instructor wrong. He had survived the Trials. He was in Kanjiram Academy. It was just the first step, he knew, a small victory in a long, uncertain journey. But for this moment, in the quiet solitude of the dormitory bunk, that small smile was everything.</p>
