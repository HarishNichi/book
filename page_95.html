            <p>Anirudh held the scroll in his hands, the ancient seal of the War Council of Realms a stark reminder of his father's fate. He carefully broke the seal, the parchment unrolling to reveal elegant script. It was a formal invitation, requesting his presence at an elite gathering of leaders and powerful individuals from across the realms.</p>
            <p>His heart hammered against his ribs. This was the very council where his father, the legendary Thunder Heir, had been betrayed. A knot of apprehension tightened in his gut. Was this a trap? A cruel twist of fate bringing him to the same place of his family's greatest tragedy?</p>
            <p>He looked at Arjun, who watched him with an unreadable expression. The master had always been cryptic, guiding Anirudh's path without revealing the full picture. Was this part of his plan? A final, dangerous test?</p>
            <p>The invitation was more than just a summons; it was a direct confrontation with the past, a potential step into a political landscape far more treacherous than any arena. It was a world of veiled threats, shifting alliances, and power plays where strength of arms was not always enough.</p>
