            <p> Rudrak, the Thunder Heir, was an absolute force of nature. Every strike of his seemed to split the very earth beneath them, sending tremors through the arena. Anirudh, despite the immense growth he had experienced, felt the overwhelming power of his opponent. His new techniques, honed through trials and scrolls, were meeting a wall of pure, unyielding might.</p>
            <p>He dodged and weaved, using his developing Wind Thunder Form, but Rudrak anticipated his movements with brutal efficiency. A thunderous punch connected with Anirudh's guard, sending a jolt of raw power up his arms. He gritted his teeth, pushing back, but it was like standing against a storm.</p>
