            <p>Rudrak's power was overwhelming. Each strike felt like the impact of thunder itself, shaking the very ground beneath Anirudh's feet. Anirudh, despite his newfound skills and the knowledge gleaned from the Whispering Scrolls, was being pushed to his absolute limit.</p>
            <p>He used the fluid evasion of the Wind Thunder Form, attempting to redirect Rudrak's devastating blows, but the sheer force was too much to simply deflect. He tried to find an opening, a weakness, but Rudrak was a wall of raw power.</p>
