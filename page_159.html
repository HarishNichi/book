    <p>The battle was a clash of light and darkness. Anirudh's Vayu Vajra form, a whirlwind of golden energy, against the cult leader's void magic, a vortex of blackness that consumed all it touched.</p>
    <p>They fought for what seemed like an eternity, the temple shaking with the force of their blows. Anirudh was pushed to his limits, his body screaming in protest. But he did not falter. He was fighting for his past, his future, and for all the innocent lives the cult had destroyed.</p>
