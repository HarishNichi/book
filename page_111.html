            <h1>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h1>
            <h2>Scene: Rebirth of Will</h2>
            <p>Anirudh, back in the quiet solitude of the mountain cave, felt a profound shift. The incomplete resurrection scroll, once a mystery, now spoke to him.</p>
            <p>The trials against the Flame Serpent, the Ice Tiger, and the Phantom Crow hadn't just been tests of skill; they were lessons in adaptation, resilience, and the subtle flow of spiritual energy.</p>
            <p>He closed his eyes, recalling the serpentine grace, the tiger's explosive power, the crow's ethereal movement. He began to move, not mimicking the forms he had learned, but weaving them together, guided by an instinct born of his recent struggles.</p>
            <p>A new energy stirred within him â€“ fluid yet potent, elusive yet striking.</p>
