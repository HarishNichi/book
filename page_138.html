            <p>Arjun's words hung in the air, heavy with meaning. Anirudh felt a shift, not just in their dynamic, but within himself. He wasn't striving to be his father, or even Arjun. He was forging his own path.</p>
            <p>"Not surpassed," Anirudh replied, his voice calm and steady. "Only accepted who I am."</p>
            <p>Arjun looked at him, a flicker of pride in his eyes. Then, in a gesture that spoke volumes, he bowed. It was not the bow of a master to a student, but of one warrior to another, acknowledging equality.</p>
            <p>The air in the hidden dojo seemed to shimmer with unspoken understanding. Years of rigorous training, hardship, and self-discovery had culminated in this moment.</p>
