    <div class="scene">
        <p class="narration">The Announcer's voice echoed across the Stone Arena, the stark declaration hanging in the air. Only ten. Ten out of fifty would earn a place within the hallowed halls of Kanjiram Academy. The remaining students, a motley crew of the bruised and battered, eyed each other with a mix of weariness and desperate hope.</p>

        <p class="narration">Then, the final challenge was revealed. A figure emerged from the shadows at the edge of the arena, stepping into the dusty sunlight. They were tall, cloaked, their face hidden behind a plain, dark mask. An aura of quiet, formidable strength radiated from them, a sense of anonymity that made them all the more intimidating. This was to be the last hurdle: hand-to-hand combat against a masked instructor.</p>

        <p class="narration">Anirudh, his muscles screaming in protest, his breath ragged, felt a surge of something primal. Exhaustion was a heavy cloak, but beneath it burned a fire that the trials had only fanned. He watched the masked instructor, his gaze fixed, unblinking.</p>

        <p class="narration">One by one, the remaining students hesitated, some visibly wilting at the prospect of facing such a formidable opponent. But Anirudh didn't falter. He took a step forward, then another, separating himself from the small, anxious cluster of hopefuls. His worn boots crunched on the arena grit, every movement a testament to sheer will.</p>

        <p class="narration">He stood before the masked instructor, a lone figure against a backdrop of murmuring onlookers and the vast, indifferent sky. He was battered, yes, but his gaze was clear, his jaw set. Unwavering determination was etched into every line of his weary face.</p>
