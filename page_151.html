    <p>After leaving the Kanjiram Academy, Anirudh began his journey into the wider world. He was no longer just a student; he was a warrior on a quest. He traveled from city to city, from village to village, always searching for clues about his past, for any mention of the Alchemist King or the Crimson Pendant.</p>
    <p>He took on odd jobs to survive, working as a mercenary, a guard, a guide. He fought in underground tournaments, testing his skills against the best fighters in the land. He honed his Vayu Vajra form, his movements becoming more fluid, more powerful, more his own.</p>
