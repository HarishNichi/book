    <h1>Child of the Crimson Pendant - Page 24</h1>

    <h2>INT. ACADEMY DORMITORY – NIGHT</h2>

    <p>The air in the Kanjiram Academy dormitory hung thick with the scent of sweat, liniment, and damp stone. Rows of simple, hard bunks lined the walls, each with a thin mattress and a rough wool blanket. There was no attempt at comfort, no personal touches – just functional, spartan living quarters designed for discipline and recovery.</p>

    <p>ANIRUDH lay on one of these bunks, his body a roadmap of the day's brutal trials. Bandages were wrapped around his ribs, his knuckles were taped, and a fresh bruise bloomed on his cheekbone. Every muscle ached, a dull, throbbing testament to the gauntlet he had just survived.</p>

    <p>He stared up at the rough-hewn ceiling, his chest rising and falling in slow, measured breaths. Despite the physical discomfort, a quiet sense of relief settled over him. He had done it. He had faced the trials, faced the prejudice, and emerged... one of the ten.</p>

    <p>A small, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips. It wasn't a triumphant grin, but a private, weary acknowledgment of a hard-won victory. He was bruised, yes, and utterly exhausted, but beneath it all, there was a flicker of accomplishment, a quiet pride in his own resilience.</p>
