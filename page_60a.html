            <p>The creature of shadow and malice lunged, its form indistinct yet radiating a chilling aura. Kaelen met its charge, his sword clanging against the ethereal projection with a dull, unsatisfying thud. The blow, which would have staggered a lesser foe, passed through the creature with minimal effect, like striking smoke.</p>
            <p>"It's not entirely corporeal!" Kaelen yelled, dodging a sweeping claw that left shimmering trails of dark energy in the air. "We can't fight it head-on!"</p>
            <p>Elara's focus was on the Heartstone. The vision was gone, but the stone now pulsed with a sickly green light, tethering the creature to their plane. She could feel the connection, a discordant hum that grated against her senses. It was the source. It had to be.</p>
            <p>"The stone is its anchor!" Elara cried out, her mind racing. "I have to break the connection!"</p>
            <p>Ignoring the immediate danger, she pushed her own energy towards the stone, not with force, but with a plea. She focused on the ancient magic within, the magic of balance, and tried to soothe the chaotic energy that had been unleashed. The stone flared, resisting her, the creature letting out a piercing shriek as its form flickered.</p>
