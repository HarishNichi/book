            <p>The transition from the cavern's mystical silence to the raw energy of the Forest of Shadows was jarring. Sunlight filtered through the dense canopy, dappling the forest floor in shifting patterns. But this was no ordinary forest; it pulsed with an ancient, untamed power. This was the next phase of Anirudh's training, facing not mere predators, but creatures imbued with spiritual might.</p>
            <p>Arjun had led him deep into the woods, his movements as silent and fluid as the wind. He stopped at a clearing, the air growing heavy with an unseen force. "The Whispering Scrolls have opened your mind, Anirudh," Arjun's voice was low, a rumble like distant thunder. "Now, you must face the physical manifestations of that power. The Animal Trials begin."</p>
            <p>Before them, the ground shimmered, and a creature of pure fire coalesced â€“ the Flame Serpent. Its scales gleamed like molten gold, and its eyes burned with an intense heat. Smoke curled from its nostrils, carrying the scent of brimstone.</p>
            <p>"The Flame Serpent," Arjun stated, a hint of respect in his tone. "Its movements are as unpredictable as fire. Its breath can turn stone to ash. You must face it alone. Remember what the scrolls have taught you. Adapt. Evolve."</p>
            <p>Anirudh felt a tremor of apprehension, but beneath it, a surge of determination. He bowed to Arjun, then turned to face the blazing creature. The heat radiating from the serpent was oppressive, and the air around it seemed to writhe.</p>
