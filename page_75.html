            <h1>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h1>
            <h2>Scene 4: First Major Loss</h2>
            <p>The Thunder Heir's power was absolute. Rudrak's movements were a symphony of raw, untamed energy, each strike a thunderclap against the arena floor. Anirudh, despite his newfound skills, found himself consistently a step behind, his defenses cracking under the relentless onslaught.</p>
            <p>He tried to anticipate, to use the echo-foot technique he'd mastered against Garo, but Rudrak's power wasn't just physical; it was a force of nature, unpredictable and overwhelming.</p>
            <p>Each blocked strike sent shockwaves up his arms, numbing his limbs. The crowd's roar was a distant echo as Anirudh focused solely on survival, on finding an opening that wasn't there.</p>
