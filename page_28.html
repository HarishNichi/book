    <h1>The Orphan's Shadow - Page 28</h1>

    <p>Silence hung thick in the air of the dormitory, punctuated only by the distant sounds of the academy settling down for the night. Anirudh lay on his thin mattress, every muscle aching, every bruise a testament to the brutal trials. He clutched the copper pendant in his hand, its cool metal a small comfort against his sweaty palm.</p>

    <p>The Instructor's voice, amplified by some unseen artifice, cut through the quiet once more. It was crisp, devoid of emotion, listing the names of those who had passed, those who had earned a place within the hallowed halls of Kanjiram.</p>

    <p>Nine names were called. Each one, a pang of anxiety in Anirudh's chest. Nine students, with their fine clothes and privileged backgrounds, were confirmed. His own name hadn't been among them. Doubt, cold and sharp, began to creep into his thoughts. Had he pushed himself for nothing? Had the fight against the masked instructor, the gasps of surprise, been ultimately meaningless?</p>

    <p>He closed his eyes, focusing on the weight of the pendant, trying to draw strength from whatever mystery it held. He pictured his mother's face, a fading memory but a powerful anchor. He remembered the mocking laughter of the boys outside the academy gates, the derision of the noble-born hopefuls in line. He wouldn't let them be right.</p>

    <p>Then, the voice again, clearer this time, a final name.</p>

    <p>"...Tenth."</p>

    <p>Anirudh held his breath.</p>

    <p>"Anirudh."</p>

    <p>A sharp intake of breath. His eyes snapped open, wide with surprise. His heart, which had been a lead weight in his chest, suddenly soared. His body, moments ago wracked with pain, felt a surge of adrenaline. Anirudh. His name. He had done it. Tenth place. The lowest possible entry point, but entry nonetheless.</p>

    <p>A small, shaky smile touched his lips as the reality sank in. He, the orphan with no name, no backing, no privilege, had earned his place among the elite.</p>
