            <p>Anirudh stared at the incomplete scroll, the one titled “To Rise, First Die.” It spoke of a resurrection technique, a death style, but the crucial steps, the very essence of the revival, were missing. A bitter laugh escaped him, raspy and hollow.</p>

            <p>"Am I just my father’s shadow?" he whispered to the empty healing chamber, the question a raw wound in his soul. "Or something else entirely?"</p>

            <p>The weight of his defeat pressed down on him. Rudrak's power had been absolute, a force of nature he couldn't comprehend, let alone counter. Every technique Arjun had taught him, every lesson absorbed from the Whispering Scrolls, had been insufficient.</p>

            <p>He closed his eyes, the image of Rudrak's thunder fist burning behind his eyelids. The impact had shaken him to his core, not just physically, but in his very understanding of his own limitations.</p>

            <p>Was he destined to forever walk in the footsteps of the legendary Thunder Heir? Was his journey simply a pale imitation of a greatness he could never truly achieve?</p>
