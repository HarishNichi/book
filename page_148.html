            <h3>Scene 8: The Master's Acknowledgment (Continued)</h3>
            <p>Anirudh stepped back, a quiet confidence in his stance. "Not surpassed," he corrected softly. "Only accepted who I am."</p>
            <p>Arjun's eyes, ancient and wise, held Anirudh's gaze for a long moment. A slow smile spread across the master's face.</p>
            <p>Then, in a gesture that spoke volumes, Arjun bowed. It was not the bow of a master to a student, but of equals acknowledging each other's journey.</p>
