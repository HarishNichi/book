        <h2>Scene 1: The Whispering Scrolls</h2>

        <p>Arjun opened an ancient vault hidden deep within the mountain temple. The heavy stone door groaned, revealing a chamber bathed in an ethereal light. Inside, shimmering scrolls floated mid-air, each radiating a faint hum of power. These were not ordinary texts; they contained the lost knowledge of martial styles, forgotten techniques whispered through generations.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p class="character">ARJUN</p>
            <p class="line">(softly) These are the Whispering Scrolls… read them, feel them. They will answer you if you're ready.</p>

        <p>Anirudh stepped forward, his heart pounding with a mixture of awe and anticipation. He reached out and touched one of the scrolls. As his fingers brushed against the ancient parchment, it glowed intensely and then dissolved into a rush of energy that flowed directly into his mind. Visions flashed before his eyes – glimpses of warriors engaged in impossible battles, performing feats that defied gravity and logic.</p>
