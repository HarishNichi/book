        <h1>Child of the Crimson Pendant - Page 18</h1>

        <p>The masked instructor's words hung in the air, sharp and dismissive. They were meant to wound, to expose a perceived weakness. But for Anirudh, the word "orphan" wasn't a weakness. It was the fire that burned in his gut, the invisible armor forged in years of scraping by, of fighting for every scrap, every breath.</p>

        <p>His exhaustion was a dull ache in his limbs, but his eyes, though shadowed with fatigue, blazed with an unyielding light. He straightened his shoulders, drawing on a reservoir of strength that had nothing to do with muscle and everything to do with will.</p>

        <p><span class="character">ANIRUDH</span></p>
        <p>"Orphans fight harder. We have more to prove."</p>

        <p>His voice was rough, raw with emotion, but clear and steady. It carried the weight of fifteen years of struggle, of being underestimated and cast aside. Every hardship, every mocking glance, every empty belly fueled the conviction behind those words. He wasn't just fighting for a place in the academy; he was fighting for his very existence, for the right to stand tall in a world that had tried to keep him down.</p>

        <p>Inside, a storm of defiance raged, mirroring the one that had marked his birth. They wanted him to falter, to surrender to the labels they tried to attach to him. But he wouldn't. He couldn't. Not when his entire life had led him to this moment, this chance to shatter their expectations.</p>
