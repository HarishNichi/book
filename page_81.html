            <h2>Scene 6: Village in Peril</h2>
            <p>Anirudh arrived back in his hometown, the air thick with the smell of smoke and fear.

They were a horrifying distortion of the forest animals he had faced in his trials, twisted by some dark, unknown force.</p>
            <p>Panic was starting to set in among the villagers. Walls were breached, and desperate attempts to defend themselves were failing against the onslaught.</p>
