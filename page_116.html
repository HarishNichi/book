            <h2>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h2>
            <h3>Scene: Rebirth of Will</h3>
            <p>Anirudh felt the familiar weight of the ancient scrolls in his hands. The mountain cave was silent, a stark contrast to the roar of the beasts and the shouts of battle he had recently faced. His hands traced the intricate patterns on the incomplete "To Rise, First Die" scroll. Before, it felt like a riddle he couldn't solve. Now, after facing true fear and protecting his home, something shifted.</p>
            <p>The trials against the spiritual beasts – the cunning of the Phantom Crow, the raw power of the Ice Tiger, the elusive nature of the Flame Serpent – they weren't just tests of physical skill. They were lessons in adapting, in understanding different energies and movements. The silence meditation Arjun had taught him, once a mere technique for focus, had become a way to listen to the subtle flow of energy within himself and the world around him.</p>
            <p>Holding the incomplete resurrection scroll, Anirudh closed his eyes. He didn't just see the glyphs; he felt the intent behind them, the core principle of transformation. It wasn't about coming back from death in a literal sense, not for him. It was about the death of old limitations, the shedding of expectations.</p>
            <p>He began to move, not replicating the forms of his father or the techniques Arjun had painstakingly shown him. Instead, he allowed the echo of the beasts' movements, the feel of the wind steps, the grounding of the earth-shattering blows of Rudrak, and the stillness of meditation to guide him.</p>
