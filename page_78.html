                <p>The air in the healing chamber was thick with the scent of herbs and the low murmur of the temple healers attending to the injured fighters from the tournament. Anirudh lay on a simple cot, the throbbing ache in his body a constant reminder of Rudrak's power.</p>
                <p>He stared at the ceiling, the ornate carvings blurring through his tired eyes. The image of Rudrak's final thunderous blow replayed in his mind. He had trained, he had grown, he had pushed his limits, yet it wasn't enough.</p>
                <p>He was offered a scroll by one of the healers. It was old and brittle, titled “To Rise, First Die”. He recognized the script as ancient, hinting at a death-style resurrection technique, but as he examined it, he saw that sections were missing, the technique incomplete.</p>
                <p>Frustration gnawed at him. Was this his destiny? To always fall short? To be merely a shadow of his father's legacy? He couldn't shake the feeling that no matter how hard he tried, he was defined by his lineage, not his own strength.</p>
                <p class="dialogue">ANIRUDH</p>
                <p class="dialogue">(to himself)</p>
                <p class="dialogue">Am I just my father’s shadow? Or something else entirely?</p>
                <p>The question echoed in the quiet chamber, heavy with the weight of his defeat and his uncertain future.</p>
