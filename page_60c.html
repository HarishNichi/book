            <p>Meanwhile, hundreds of miles away, Anirudh sat polishing his staff in the courtyard of the Kanjiram Academy. Weeks had passed since the trials, yet he felt more like an outsider than ever. The other students, with their noble lineages and formal training, treated him with a mixture of suspicion and scorn. His raw talent was undeniable, but it was untamed, and the instructors seemed more interested in curbing his spirit than nurturing it.</p>
