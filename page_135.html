            <h2>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h2>
            <h3>Scene 8: The Master's Acknowledgment (Continued)</h3>
            <p>Arjun stepped back, a rare look of pride on his face.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">ARJUN<br>(softly)<br>You have surpassed my teachings, Anirudh.</p>
            <p>Anirudh lowered his head, a sense of peace washing over him. He hadn't sought to exceed his master, only to find his own truth.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">ANIRUDH<br>Not surpassed. Only accepted who I am.</p>
            <p>The air in the hidden dojo shifted. The dynamic between master and student dissolved, replaced by a quiet understanding.</p>
