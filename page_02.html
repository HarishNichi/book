 <h1>The Orphan's Shadow</h1>

 <div class="narration">
 The storm howled with renewed fury, a symphony of wind and rain against the fragile walls of the hut. The single lamp flickered wildly, casting dancing shadows that mirrored the turmoil in the young woman's heart. Her breath came in ragged gasps, each one a struggle against the pain that was stealing her life, a struggle intensified by the overwhelming need to protect the tiny life she held so fiercely.

The faint glow of the alchemical symbol seemed to pulse in time with her fading heartbeat, a silent promise in the chaos. Every fiber of her being screamed for more time, just a moment longer to imprint her love, her hopes, her warnings onto this precious child. But time, like her strength, was running out. Thunder exploded directly overhead, shaking the very foundations of the hut. It was a sound of finality, a drumbeat announcing the inevitable. The rickety door, already groaning under the storm's assault, was thrown inward with a splintering crash.

A single, sharp gasp escaped her lips – the sound of hope being extinguished. The hooded man took a step inside, and the world narrowed. The storm’s roar faded, the flickering light seemed to shrink, and the air grew heavy with a chilling presence. The last thing the woman saw was the inky blackness of the cloak consuming the doorway, a void promising only oblivion. Then, everything went dark
