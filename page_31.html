        <p>INT. LIBRARY – SECRET CORNER – NIGHT</p>

        <p>The Kanjiram Academy library was less a room and more a labyrinth of knowledge. Towering shelves stretched towards a ceiling lost in shadow, heavy tomes lining every surface. The air was thick with the scent of aged paper and dust motes danced in the faint moonlight filtering through high, arched windows.</p>

        <p>Anirudh moved through the silent aisles, a small, dark figure navigating the vastness. He knew this section was forbidden. Whispers among the students warned of curses, guardians, or simply the wrath of the Instructors for those who dared trespass. But Anirudh was used to ignoring warnings.</p>

        <p>He found the section tucked away in the deepest corner, behind a shelf that looked no different from the others but yielded to a specific touch he'd observed a senior student use weeks ago. The air here felt colder, heavier.</p>
