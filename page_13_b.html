    <p>The rivalry between Anirudh and Rohan simmered, a constant source of tension in the academy. Rohan, with his polished skills and influential family, missed no opportunity to belittle Anirudh. He would mock his form during training, "correct" his technique with a condescending tone, and spread rumors about the "orphan who thinks he's a warrior."</p>
    <p>Anirudh, for his part, refused to be drawn into open conflict. He met Rohan's taunts with a quiet determination that seemed to infuriate Rohan even more. He focused on his own training, his unorthodox methods yielding results that even the instructors couldn't ignore. He was not just surviving; he was excelling, and this only fueled Rohan's resentment.</p>
