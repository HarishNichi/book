            <h1>Act 2: Rise of the Storm</h1>
            <h2>Scene 7: Rebirth of Will</h2>
            
            <p>Anirudh felt the weight of the incomplete scroll in his hand, a puzzle missing crucial pieces. He had returned to the silent embrace of the mountain cave, the same place where his journey with Arjun had begun. But this time, he sought answers not from a master, but from within himself and the echoes of his recent trials.</p>

            <p>The Tournament of Rising Suns, the sting of defeat against Rudrak, the primal fear faced in his besieged village – each experience had chipped away at the layers of expectation and the shadows of his father’s legacy. He was no longer just a student trying to emulate greatness, but a warrior forged in the crucible of real struggle.</p>

            <p>He laid the incomplete scroll on a smooth, ancient stone. Its cryptic symbols seemed to mock him, hinting at a power just beyond his grasp – a death-style resurrection technique that could reshape his very being. But the path to unlocking it lay not in blindly following ancient wisdom, but in integrating his own hard-won knowledge.</p>

            <p>He closed his eyes, focusing on the swirling energies that now felt intimately connected to him. He recalled the fluid evasion learned while dancing with the Flame Serpent’s fire, the grounded power of the Ice Tiger’s stance, and the ethereal senses honed against the Phantom Crow’s illusions. These were not mere techniques; they were expressions of the natural world's raw power.</p>
