    <div class="setting">INT. KANJIRAM ACADEMY – MAIN GATE – DAY (CONTINUOUS)</div>

    <div class="action">
        Anirudh stood near the front of the long, winding line of hopefuls. The grand gate of Kanjiram Academy loomed behind the stern-faced instructors, a promise of power and prestige. Around him, the other applicants, predominantly noble-born, fidgeted in their fine tunics and polished boots, their faces a mixture of nervousness and entitlement. Anirudh, in his simple, patched clothes, was a stark contrast, drawing uncomfortable, scrutinizing glances.

    <div class="character">INSTRUCTOR</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        (Voice like grinding stone)
        Name?
    </div>

    <div class="character">ANIRUDH</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        Anirudh. No last name.
    </div>

    <div class="action">
        A collective intake of breath rippled through the line. Faces that had merely been dismissive now twisted into expressions of outright scorn and pity.
    </div>

    <div class="action">
        Whispers, sharp and sudden, erupted around Anirudh, though no one dared to speak directly to him.
    </div>

    <div class="whispers">
        "Orphan."
    </div>
    <div class="whispers">
        "Untitled."
    </div>
    <div class="whispers">
        "Worthless."
    </div>
    <div class="whispers">
        "He thinks he can stand among us?"
    </div>
    <div class="whispers">
        "A nobody."
    </div>
 
    <div class="action">
        Anirudh felt the sting of their words but held his gaze steady on the instructor, his jaw set.
    </div>

    <div class="character">INSTRUCTOR</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        (Looking him up and down, a flicker of something unreadable in their eyes)
        We’ll see if you survive the Trials. Step forward when called.
    </div>

    <div class="action">
        The instructor gestured for the next applicant, dismissing Anirudh with a final, cold look. Anirudh moved to the side, the weight of the whispered judgements pressing in, but his resolve remained unbroken. The Trials. His chance to prove them wrong.
