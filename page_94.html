            <p>The Whispering Scrolls radiated an energy that felt both ancient and alive. Anirudh, guided by Arjun's quiet presence, extended his hand towards the closest one. As his fingers brushed the surface, a jolt of pure power surged through him. It wasn't painful, but it was intense, like a thousand voices speaking at once inside his mind.</p>
            <p>Images flashed before his eyes: warriors performing impossible feats, their movements fluid and devastating. He saw strikes that could shatter stone, defenses that were impenetrable, and movements that seemed to defy the laws of physics. These were the echoes of masters long gone, their knowledge preserved within these shimmering scrolls.</p>
            <p>Each vision was a lesson, a demonstration of a martial style honed over lifetimes. Anirudh felt the principles of each technique settling into his consciousness, not just as theoretical knowledge, but as ingrained instinct. He saw the flow of energy within the body, the connection between mind and movement, the subtle shifts that could turn the tide of battle.</p>
