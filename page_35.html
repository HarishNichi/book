                <p>The air grew heavy with unspoken tension as Elara and Lyra exchanged glances. The metallic scent, now mingled with something else – something almost electrical – prickled at their senses. It wasn't the familiar smell of ozone after a storm, but something far more ancient and unsettling. It felt like the residue of power that had been unleashed, not by nature, but by intent.</p>

                <p>"What is that smell?" Lyra whispered, her hand instinctively going to the hilt of her dagger. The forest, usually alive with the sounds of rustling leaves and chirping birds, had fallen unnervingly silent. Even the wind seemed to hold its breath.</p>

                <p>Elara didn't answer immediately. Her eyes, usually bright and expressive, were narrowed in concentration, scanning the dense undergrowth. She could feel a faint tremor in the earth beneath their feet, a subtle vibration that resonated with the strange scent. It was as if the very ground was humming with a low, resonant frequency.</p>

                <p>"It's... magic," Elara finally said, her voice barely above a murmur. "But not like anything I've encountered before. It feels raw, untamed. And old. Very, very old."</p>

                <p>A shiver ran down Lyra's spine. Old magic. The tales her grandmother had told her of the First Age, of powers that could reshape landscapes and tear holes in the fabric of reality, flashed through her mind. These were not the gentle, weaving spells of the mages she knew, but something far more fundamental and dangerous.</p>

                <p>They moved forward cautiously, each step deliberate and quiet. The path twisted and turned, leading them deeper into the heart of the ancient woods. The trees here were gnarled and twisted, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers, casting long, eerie shadows in the dappled sunlight.</p>
