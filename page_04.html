            EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF KANJIRAM ACADEMY – EARLY MORNING
        </div>

        <div class="narration">
            The heavy wooden staff WHUMPS against the ancient, gnarled tree, the impact sending a tremor up Anirudh’s calloused hands. Sweat drips from his brow, staining the worn fabric of his tunic. Each swing is deliberate, fueled by a quiet, burning ambition. He moves with a raw, unrefined grace, the lean muscles of his arms and shoulders working in a rhythm born of countless hours of solitary practice. The tattered edges of his trousers snag on the rough bark, but he barely notices, his focus absolute on the imaginary opponent before him.

        <div class="character">VILLAGER (O.S.)</div>
        <div class="dialogue">
            Oi! Still at it, orphan? You’ll break that poor tree before you break into that fancy academy! You’re dreaming higher than your rags can carry you!
        </div>

        <div class="narration">
            Anirudh pauses his swing mid-arc, a thin, genuine grin spreading across his face, revealing a flash of determination in his eyes. The villager's jibe doesn't sting; it fuels him.
        </div>

        <div class="character">ANIRUDH</div>
        <div class="dialogue">
            (grinning)
            Then I’ll break both. And walk right through the gates on the splinters.
        </div>

        <div class="narration">
            Without another word, he turns back to the tree, the grin fading, replaced by fierce concentration. The staff resumes its rhythmic assault. The villager's laughter, a dry, dismissive sound, drifts away on the morning breeze, but Anirudh doesn't hear it. He is already focused on the next strike, the next movement, the path ahead.
