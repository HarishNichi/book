            <p>INT. HEALING CHAMBER - NIGHT</p>

            <p>Anirudh stirs, the dull ache of defeat a heavy blanket. His body protests with every movement, a stark reminder of Rudrak's power. The sterile air of the healing chamber does little to soothe the sting of his first true loss. He pushes himself up, wincing, the silken sheets cool against his skin. The room is dimly lit by soft, pulsing crystals embedded in the walls, casting long, dancing shadows.</p>

            <p>His mind races, replaying the thunderous blows, the earth-shattering force that had overwhelmed him. He had grown stronger, faster, more attuned to his energy, yet it hadn't been enough. He had fallen, a harsh reality crashing down after the exhilarating climb of his victories.</p>

            <p>He glances at his hands, flexing his fingers. They tremble slightly, not from physical pain, but from the echo of failure. Was this it? Was his potential capped? Was he destined to forever live in the shadow of his father's legacy, a legacy built on triumphs he now felt he could never achieve?</p>
