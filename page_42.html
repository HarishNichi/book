            <p>The air in the room grew heavy, thick with unspoken words and a palpable tension. Elias watched Seraphina, his gaze searching for any sign of the truth behind her carefully constructed composure. He knew her well enough to recognize the subtle tells â€“ the slight tremor in her hand, the way she avoided direct eye contact when she was keeping something hidden.</p>
            <p>He took a slow, deliberate step closer, his voice low and gentle. "Seraphina, please. Whatever it is, you can tell me. We've faced worse together, haven't we?"</p>
            <p>A flicker of pain crossed her features, quickly masked. She turned away, walking to the small window and staring out at the swirling mist that had settled over the city. "Some things, Elias, are best left unsaid. For everyone's safety."</p>
            <p>His heart ached at her words. This wasn't the Seraphina he knew, the one who faced danger head-on with unwavering courage. This was someone burdened, haunted by a secret she felt she had to carry alone.</p>
            <p>"Safety?" he echoed, a hint of frustration creeping into his tone. "What could be so dangerous that you can't even share it with me? After everything we've been through?"</p>
            <p>She was silent for a long moment, the only sound the distant tolling of a bell. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely a whisper. "It's about the prophecy, Elias. And the role I must play in it."</p>
