            <p>Rudrak, The Thunder Heir. His reputation preceded him like the boom before a storm. Unbeatable, they whispered. His strikes didnâ€™t just land; they fractured the very earth beneath the arena. Anirudh, despite the newfound knowledge from the Whispering Scrolls, despite the lessons from the animal trials, felt a chilling, unfamiliar dread creep into his core.</p>

            <p>The roar of the crowd faded into a dull hum as Rudrak stepped into the arena. He was a mountain of a man, crackling with an energy that mirrored the tempest itself. This was not just a fight; this was a force of nature against a burgeoning warrior.</p>

            <p>The first exchange was a blur of power. Rudrak's fist, imbued with the raw might of thunder, slammed into the ground where Anirudh had stood moments before, leaving a smoking crater. Anirudh dodged, using the fluid movements of the Flame Serpent style, weaving through the devastating blows.</p>

            <p>He tried the precision of the Ice Tiger, aiming for weak points, but Rudrak seemed impervious, his skin glowing with a protective aura of crackling energy. The echo-foot technique that had served him so well against Garo was useless here; Rudrak's movements were not just fast, they were overwhelming, leaving no space for prediction, only reaction.</p>

            <p>Anirudh felt the sting of failure with each blocked blow, each parried strike. His growth was undeniable, his skills honed, but against this power, it felt like chipping away at a granite cliff face with a pebble.</p>
