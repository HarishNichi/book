    <p>After the trial of power, Anirudh was cleaning his staff when Rohan and his friends approached him. Rohan's face was a mask of disdain.</p>
    <div class="character">ROHAN</div>
    <div class="dialogue">(With a sneer)</div>
    <div class="dialogue">You call that a demonstration of power? Using a lever like a common laborer? You have no honor, orphan. You don't belong here.</div>
    <p>Anirudh simply looked at him, his expression unreadable. He did not rise to the bait. He knew that true strength was not about brute force, but about ingenuity and resilience. He had proven that today.</p>
    <div class="character">ANIRUDH</div>
    <div class="dialogue">(Calmly)</div>
    <div class="dialogue">I am still here, am I not?</div>
    <p>Rohan, furious at Anirudh's calm demeanor, clenched his fists. He was not used to being challenged, especially by someone he considered his inferior. He stormed off, his friends trailing behind him, leaving Anirudh in peace.</p>
