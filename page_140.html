            <h3>Scene 8: The Master's Acknowledgment (Continued)</h3>
            <p>Arjun stepped back, a rare smile gracing his lips. It wasn't a smile of amusement, but one of profound respect. Anirudh felt the shift in the air between them. The dynamic of master and student had dissolved, replaced by a quiet acknowledgment of equals.</p>
            <p>"You have surpassed my teachings, Anirudh," Arjun said, his voice soft but resonating with sincerity.</p>
            <p>Anirudh met his gaze, a sense of peace settling within him. "Not surpassed, Master Arjun. Only accepted who I am. The Vayu Vajra is not a rejection of your path, but the path I was always meant to walk."</p>
            <p>Arjun nodded slowly, then, to Anirudh's surprise, bowed his head slightly. It was a gesture that spoke volumes, a silent declaration of Anirudh's achievement and the completion of this stage of his training.</p>
