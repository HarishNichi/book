# Page 1 – Opening Scene: The Storm

INT. VILLAGE HUT – NIGHT

A violent storm rages outside. Inside a crumbling hut, a young woman lies on the floor, holding a newborn wrapped in a tattered cloth.

WOMAN
(whispers with tears)
Anirudh... my little warrior. Forgive me...

She wraps a copper pendant around the baby’s neck—etched with a strange alchemical symbol glowing faintly.

WOMAN (V.O.)
Your father’s blood flows through you. You must live... even if I cannot.

Thunder cracks. The door bursts open. A hooded man stands in the shadow. She gasps—then everything goes dark.
