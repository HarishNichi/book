    <p>One evening, in the academy's vast library, Anirudh was researching ancient texts, searching for any mention of the symbol on his pendant. He had found a secluded corner, away from the other students. He was engrossed in a heavy, leather-bound tome when a shadow fell over the page.</p>
    <p>It was Rohan. He was not alone. His usual group of sycophants stood behind him, their arms crossed, smirks on their faces.</p>
    <div class="character">ROHAN</div>
    <div class="dialogue">(In a loud whisper)</div>
    <div class="dialogue">Look at him. The orphan thinks he can read. What are you looking for, a spell to conjure up a family?</div>
    <p>Anirudh slowly closed the book, his gaze meeting Rohan's. He did not say a word. He simply stood up, his quiet dignity a stark contrast to Rohan's boorishness. He walked away, leaving Rohan fuming in the silence of the library.</p>
