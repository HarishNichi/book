            <h2>Act 2, Scene 3: The Tournament of Rising Suns</h2>
            <h3>Round 2: Anirudh vs Vana, The Sound Bender</h3>
            <p>Vanaâ€™s attacks were unlike anything Anirudh had faced. She didn't rely on physical strikes; instead, she manipulated the very air, shaping sound waves into tangible forces that battered his senses and disoriented his movements. High-pitched frequencies assaulted his ears, making it impossible to gauge distance or direction. Low, resonant hums vibrated through the ground, threatening to shatter his stance.</p>
            <p>Anirudh stumbled, his vision blurring from the onslaught. He felt like he was fighting blind, every sense screaming in protest against the invisible assault. Vana moved with an eerie grace, a conductor leading an orchestra of chaos. She seemed to anticipate his every move, deflecting his attempts to close the distance with blasts of focused sound.</p>
