                <p>"Do you feel that?" he whispered, his voice barely louder than the soft crunch of their boots on the unfamiliar ground.</p>
                <p>Lyra nodded, her eyes wide with a mixture of apprehension and awe. "It's... it's like the air itself is vibrating," she replied, her voice hushed. "But it feels... deliberate. Not like a natural tremor."</p>
                <p>The air grew colder, despite the lack of any apparent change in their surroundings. The rock formations around them seemed to twist and contort in the dim light, taking on unsettling, almost grotesque shapes. Shadows danced at the edges of their vision, not like the playful flickers of firelight, but like sentient entities watching from the periphery.</p>

It was a deep resonance that seemed to originate from the very heart of the mountain. Elias tightened his grip on the worn leather of his pack, his knuckles white. Lyra instinctively moved closer to him, her hand reaching out to touch his arm.</p>
                <p>"What was that?" she breathed, her voice trembling slightly.</p>
