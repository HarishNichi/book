            <h3>Scene: Village in Peril (Continued)</h3>
            <p>The air crackled with dark energy. Twisted creatures, their forms grotesque and menacing, emerged from the shadows, drawn by an unseen force. Anirudh's hometown, usually peaceful and vibrant, was now a scene of chaos and fear.</p>

            <p>Arjun's words echoed in his mind: "This is your test. Not in an arena. In the real world."</p>
